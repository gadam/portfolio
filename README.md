## About me
After spending my early career as a developer Iâ€™ve been in the project management space for over 10 years mainly in the financial services sector.  During that time I have worked on new systems development, updated business processes and increased efficiency via higher levels of automation.  I also delivered an enhanced Customer Servicing process by modernising a business' existing Salesforce operations applications, integrating it with the Policy Administration systems, Customer Communications platforms and introduced a rules engine to facilitate the translation of complex life insurance products into plain language and made the outcomes available to internal and external channels. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science from Macquarie University and an Masters of Business Administration from the AGSM
## My carreer goals
I love being a freelancer as I get the freedom to work with a diverse range of businesses and industry segments allowing me to see and learn how many problems, often similar, are solved using innovative approaches.
### Why Fintech
The financial services industry has almost become an innovation incubator and is poised to make significant contributions and changes to the way society evolves and I want ot be part of that journey
